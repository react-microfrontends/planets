The microfrontend for showing planets

[![CircleCI](https://circleci.com/gh/react-microfrontends/planets.svg?style=svg)](https://circleci.com/gh/react-microfrontends/planets)

## What is this?

This is an example microfrontend repo demonstrating how to use [single-spa](https://single-spa.js.org). You can see the code running at https://react.microfrontends.app.

## How does it work?

[Full article](https://single-spa.js.org/docs/recommended-setup)

This repository is a javascript project that creates a javascript bundle that is an in-browser javascript module (explanation on [youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jxqiu6pdMSU&list=PLLUD8RtHvsAOhtHnyGx57EYXoaNsxGrTU&index=2) / [bilibili](https://www.bilibili.com/video/av83498486/)). The currently deployed version of the in-browser module can be seen at https://react.microfrontends.app/importmap.json.

This project uses [React](https://reactjs.org) and was created with the [create-single-spa](https://single-spa.js.org/docs/create-single-spa) CLI. It uses webpack and babel.

Whenever a pull request is merged to master, [CircleCI builds and deploys the project](https://circleci.com/gh/react-microfrontends/planets). The ["workflows" view](https://circleci.com/gh/react-microfrontends/workflows) (pictured below) can be seen if you are logged into CircleCI. Deployments for this in-browser module are completely independent of deployments for any other module.

## Local development

[Full documentation](https://single-spa.js.org/docs/recommended-setup#local-development)

Tutorial video: [youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjjcuIxqIzY&list=PLLUD8RtHvsAOhtHnyGx57EYXoaNsxGrTU&index=4) / [bilibili](https://www.bilibili.com/video/av83617789/)

There are two ways to do local development. It is preferred to do one module at a time, whenever possible.

### One module at a time

```sh
cd planets
yarn install
yarn start --https --port 9001
```

Go to https://localhost:9001/react-mf-planets.js and verify that you are able to load the file without any SSL problems. To solve SSL problems, see [these instructions](https://improveandrepeat.com/2016/09/allowing-self-signed-certificates-on-localhost-with-chrome-and-firefox/).

Now, go to https://react.microfrontends.app. In the browser console, run the following:

```js
localStorage.setItem("devtools", true);
```

Refresh the page. Click on the tan / beige rectangle:

Set an [import map override](https://github.com/joeldenning/import-map-overrides/) to `9001`.

Refresh the page. Your local code for this module will now be running on https://react.microfrontends.app. You may make changes locally and refresh the page to see them.

### All modules together

Run the root-config project locally:

```
cd root-config
yarn install
yarn start
```

Now follow the steps above for "One module at a time" for each of the modules you wish to work on.

## Adapting for your organization

Feel free to fork and modify any files you would like when doing a proof of concept for your organization. When it's time to actually create / adapt your organization's projects, consider using [create-single-spa](https://single-spa.js.org/docs/create-single-spa) instead of forking this repository.
